# GitHub Copilot Pro for Students
As a student, you are eligible to get a GitHub Copilot Pro license for free.  If you do not already have an AI tool at your disposal (or even if you do and would like to try this), please sign up.  I believe it will be necessary to succeed in this class once we get a farther in.

You can find the link to apply on this page:  
https://docs.github.com/en/education/about-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student

They require verification of enrollment.  Of the types listed, I think the most straightforward to provide them would be the class schedule. 

To access your class schedule:
1. Log in to TECHweb
1. Click the TECHstudent tile
1. Click the Student Schedule link in the sidebar navigation
1. On the Look up a Schedule tab, click the printer icon in the top right.  A smaller window will open
1. Right-click on the window and select "Print..."
1. Select "Save as PDF" as the printer
1. Save the document as a file on your computer


Once you have that downloaded, you should be ready to apply to GitHub Education.  This is the first time I've had students sign up for Copilot, so please let me know if you run into any complications.
