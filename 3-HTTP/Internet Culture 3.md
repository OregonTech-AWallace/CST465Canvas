# Internet Culture 3
Wouldn't it be cool to go back and time and experience the Internet the way it was?  Well guess what, you can!  In 1996, the Internet Archive project was started.  This service has been spidering and downloading and archiving pages on the internet for close to 30 years now.

Before Instagram, before Facebook, even before MySpace, there was another platform out there allowing anyone to have their own website.  It was called Geocities.  At their peak, they had thousands of "sites" hosted, most of which consisted of just a page or two.  My very first website was hosted here and can be seen in all of its glory at:

For anyone that is interested, here are some different historical versions of the Oregon Tech website:  
[2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20000301015152/http://www.oit.edu/) What is this?  
[2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20020119153108/http://www.oit.edu/) I really liked the simplicity  
[2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20040606200449/http://www.oit.edu/) ColdFusion was the name of the framework used to build this site.  I worked in the Telecom department, which no longer exists  
[2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051227163824/http://www.oit.edu/) Oregon Tech moved to a Content Management System known as ADX Studio which used ASP.NEt behind the scenes.  Unfortunately, it stored all content as XML and used XSLT to transform the XML into HTML.  It sucked to work with.  Like, really sucked.  
[2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071227000640/http://www.oit.edu/) New logo was created by the marketing department.  People did not like it.  
[2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20090111201349/http://www.oit.edu/) New CMS, Sitefinity (ASP.NET).  It was winter and we were feeling festive  
[2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20110720020610/http://www.oit.edu/) Ask me about the little weather widget in the upper right and how it took down our webservers   
[2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20130805095415/http://www.oit.edu/) We've got a new logo!  
[2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150918225059/http://oit.edu/) Fresh again  
[2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208173329/http://oit.edu/) Not much changed this time  
[2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191229062134/https://www.oit.edu/) Getting a bit stale...    
[2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211229060731/https://www.oit.edu/) Major redesign, site is now running on Drupal CMS (PHP)
