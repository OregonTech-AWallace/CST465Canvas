# Web Servers
We will be talking about web servers in the context of the software, and not the physical hardware that runs the software on top of it

A **web server** is a software application that serves content to users over the internet or an intranet. It processes incoming requests from clients (typically web browsers) and delivers web pages, files, or other resources in response. Web servers are a critical component of modern web applications, enabling seamless communication between users and backend systems.

## Key Functions of a Web Server
- **Request Handling**: Receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients and processes them.
- **Content Delivery**: Serves static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) or dynamic content generated by server-side applications.
- **Resource Management**: Manages resources such as files, databases, and APIs.
- **Security**: Implements security protocols like SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracks requests and server performance for analysis.

## Common Web Servers
**Apache HTTP Server**: Open-source and highly configurable.  
**Nginx**: Known for high performance and scalability.  
**Microsoft IIS**: Integrated with Windows Server.  Feature-rich and reasonably easy to configure.
**LiteSpeed**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.


## Application Servers
An **application server** is a type of **web server**, but when compared with the web server software listed above, lacks a lot of features.  Application servers have a specific function which is to execute code written for specific frameworks


## Common Application Servers

|Server Name | Framework | Languages | Production ready?|
|---|---|---|---|
|**IIS Express**| ASP.NET Framework (Legacy) | C#, F#, VB.NET | No |
|**Kestrel**| ASP.NET Core | C#, F#, VB.NET | Yes |
|**Django Built-in Dev Server**| Django | Python | No | 
|**Gunicorn**| Django | Python | Yes |
|**Puma**| Ruby on Rails | Ruby | Yes |
|**Express.js / Next.js***| Node.js* | JavaScript, TypeScript | Yes |
|**Tomcat**| Java Servlets, Java ServerPages, Spring Boot  | Java | Yes |
|**PHP-FPM**| PHP | PHP | Yes|

**Express.js and Next.js are frameworks built on top of Node.js. While Node.js itself provides the runtime and basic application server capabilities, Express.js and Next.js extend its functionality to simplify web application development. The distinction between these as frameworks or application servers is nuanced, as they all contribute to the server-side application stack in different ways.*
