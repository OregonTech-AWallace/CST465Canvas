# Tables
- Tables are intended to display tabular data
- In the past, tables were commonly used to create page layouts because they were displayed almost identically between browsers
- With current browser functionality this is no longer necessary, and you should NEVER use tables to control layout.   

**Furthermore, if you turn in an assignment that uses tables for page layout, I will deduct points and ask that you redo the assignment.**
