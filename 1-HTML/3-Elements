# HTML Elements
## Block Elements
Block elements in HTML are elements that, by default, start on a new line and take up the full width available. They are used to structure the main parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and divs. Common block elements include 
- `<div>` - A generic block element. It has no semantic meaning.
- `<p>` - A paragraph.  
- `<h1>`â€“`<h6>` - headings
- `<ul>` - Unordered list.  Defaults to bullets in front, but this is configurable
- `<ol>` - Ordered list.  Defaults to numbers in front, but this is configurable
- `<li>` - List item.  Used to define each item within a `<ul>` or `<ol>`
- `<nav>` - Navigation.  Defines that the content contained is used to navigate within the interface or to other pages
- `<header>` - The visible header of the page.  Commonly contains items such as the top-level heading `<h1>`, site logo/tagline, and primary site navigation
- `<footer>` - Commonly contains items such as secondary site-wide navigation, copyright statements, or address/phone/contact information

## Inline Elements
Inline elements are elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically used within block elements to describe small portions of content.

Height and Width styles do not apply to inline elements, and spacing styles like margin and padding behave differently than for block elements. (More on this later).

Common inline elements include 
- `<span>` - A generic inline element.  It has no semantic meaning
- `<a>` - Anchor.
- `<strong>` - Strong.  This supercedes the `<b></b>` element from earlier versions of HTML which stood for "bold" and described style, not meaning
- `<em>` - Emphasis.  This supercedes the `<i></i>` element from earlier versions of HTML which stood for "italic" and described style, not meaning
- `<br>` - Line break.  This one is commonly confused as a block element because it causes a new line in the document, but it technically does produce an element that takes up the full width of the document.
  

## Inline-Block Elements
Some elements, like `<img>`, are considered "inline-block." They do not start on a new line and flow inline with text.  They respect width and height and handle spacing styles like margin and padding similar to block elements.

## Whitespace
In HTML, white space is ignored
