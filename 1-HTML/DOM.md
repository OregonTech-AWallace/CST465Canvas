# The Document Object Model (DOM)
When HTML is retrieved by a web browser, it is parsed and stored as an in-memory representation.  This **"living" version** of the web page is known as the **Document Object Model** or **DOM**.  

## Inspecting HTML in the Browser
All major browsers have development tools built in that allow you to inspect the HTML of rendered web pages.  These tools not only let you view the source, but also interact with it.  On Windows/Linux, you can open the developer tools in most browsers by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "Inspect" from the context menu.  I recommend you familiarize yourself with this tool as it comes in incredibly useful for web development.
