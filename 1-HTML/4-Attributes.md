# Element Attributes
Attributes are extra information that can be added to elements.  They are defined in the format `name="value"` and always placed in the opening tag.  

We saw an example of this when viewing the simplest web page:
`<html lang="en-us">`.  `lang="en-us"` is an attribute providing extra information about the `<html></html>` element

## What Attributes are Valid?
The set of valid attributes can vary greatly between elements, but there are some that are valid for **all** elements.  Below are a few common ones, but there are others.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| id | Assigns a Unique Identifie to the element.  It is invalid to use the same ID on multiple elements |
| class | Assigns one or more CSS classes to the element |
| style | Adds inline CSS styling (**avoid when possible**) |
| title | Additional info, usually shown as a tooltip |
| lang | Language of the element's content |
| data-* | A place to store your own custom data |

## Other Attributes?
There are many other attributes that are specific to elements or category of elements they belong to.  I have listed many of them on the [HTML Elements handout](/documents/Common Elements.docx).
