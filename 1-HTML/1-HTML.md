## Brief History of HTML

### Origination
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN. Its purpose was to enable researchers to share and **structure** documents over the emerging World Wide Web. The first version of HTML provided basic formatting tags for text, links, and images.   Not to say that I'm old, but I actually had the opportunity to see Tim Berners-Lee speak at a conference in 2000.

### The Early Years
HTML quickly gained traction and evolved. As the world wide web expanded past the research community and entered the hands of regular people, its usage began to morph as well. Early improvements involved forms which allowed the passing of data back to the server.  Whereas the original structure was all about the data, people wanted more.  They wanted to present the data in ways that were less boring.  This led to numerous items being added to the HTML spec for the purpose of styling the display of data instead of conveying meaning.  The late 90's saw the introduction of more advanced media, like animated GIFs and plugins to allow for movies and Java applications to be served.




### Introduction of Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)
It quickly became apparent that more flexibility/reusability of styling was needed than HTML could provide.  Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) were developed to fill this need.  They allowed for a much broader range of styles.  There are currently over 300 different CSS properties available for styling content. 

### Back to its Roots
Early versions of CSS did little to solve the problem of page layouts.  This led to a lot of misuse of HTML in order to accomplish things like navigation menus.  As more and more properties were added to the specification, advanced layouts with CSS became a reality.  HTML could finally return to its pure form as a semantic language, to convey the meaning of a document and not the visual representation of it.  The HTML 5 specification was published in 2014 with a large focus on the revival of semantic HTML. This is still the latest version of HTML.

### Present Day 
Today, HTML remains the foundation of web development.  The HTML 5 specification is still the current version and has remained largely unchanged.  The majority of innovation in web development has revolved around improvements to CSS and JavaScript on the user-facing side, and
