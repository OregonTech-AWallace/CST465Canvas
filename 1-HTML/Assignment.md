# Assignment 1: The Syllabus in HTML

## Description
Build an HTML document out of the Course Syllabus.  

## What I Expect
Create a new folder in your repository called "Lab 2" where you will build this page.

The HTML will be well formatted and use appropriate tags to describe constructs in the document (lists, tables, etc.)

The HTML will validate as HTML5 at http://validator.w3.org

The head element will have a title element

The following HTML elements will be used in the body: h1, h2, p, table, ul, ol, a, em, strong,

The following escape codes will be used: &amp; (ampersand) &gt; (greater than) &nbsp; (space)

 

## What I Don't Expect
Because of the way some elements are styled in the browser by default, your finished assignment will not look exactly like the course syllabus.  It is okay that sizing/indentation of some elements is different.  Don't worry about styling, just turn in a properly structured document.

Word has the ability to save a document as HTML.  If you attempt to save the syllabus as HTML in this manner and turn it in, the HTML that is generated is quite obvious (and abysmal) and you will get no credit.
