# Internet Culture 1
Each week, I will be introducing a little bit of internet culture, much of which is from the distant internet past.  This week, I would like to introduce Strong Bad who made his first debut in 2001 in the form of a Macromedia Flash video.  Flash was later purchased by Adobe, but then phased out altogether as video support became native to web browsers and sites like YouTube took over video hosting.  Enjoy!
