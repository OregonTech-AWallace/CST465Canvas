# Internet Culture #4: "The Dancing Baby"
The Dancing Baby was a very early "viral" video, even predating widespread use of the term "viral" to refer to fast-spreading internet content.  It was originally created in 1996 as a demonstration of the capabilities of the 3D Studio Max product and found fame being passed around through email and online discussion boards.  The original video did not contain music, but it become even more popular, when music was added and it was featured on the television show "Ally McBeal".
