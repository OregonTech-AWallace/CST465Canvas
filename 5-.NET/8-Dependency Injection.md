# Dependency Injection

## Key Terms
**Inversion of Control (IoC)** – A programming methodology where objects are given information about other objects without having to create or control them

**Dependency Injection (DI)** – A design pattern that implements IoC for resolving dependencies.  Usually this occurs by means of the constructor, but can also be done via a setter or a property

**Dependency Injection Container** – An object that stores the mappings of interface types to concrete types and resolves/instantiates them at runtime
